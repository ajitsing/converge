about: "<h4>CHANGING DIMENSIONS OF BUSINESS ANALYSIS</h4>

<p id=\"_about\" data--100-bottom-top=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(90deg) scale(.5);transform-origin:50% 0;text-align:justify\" data--100-bottom=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(0deg) scale(1)\">Whether it’s gathering requirements, coming up with lo-fi wireframes, thinking about design or facilitating workshops; in this digital era of polyglot analysts/designers/managers - all of this sounds 'business as usual' when trying to root through the client’s pain points and deriving implementable solutions. <br/>
<br/>
So how do we take it to the next level? How can we think differently to bring alternate perspectives in our engagement with customers, thereby ensuring increased business value? Is it via Platform Thinking or Design-based approach, Mobile or Web, or simply stepping in the customer’s shoes in a startup environment? <br/><br/>

Let's come together for the 5th edition of Converge to learn and share more about this multi-faceted approach to design, development and managing digital solutions.<br/><br/>
