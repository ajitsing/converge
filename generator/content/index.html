This “mobile shift” poses certain questions such as how to create, nurture, and sustain profitable customer relationships for almost every business. Some observers argue that this means “fixed” websites are in for a radical decline, and that in order to be successful, enterprises must adopt a “mobile first” approach and prioritise the user experience on mobile devices. Others maintain that mobile access, while being undeniably important, is “just another channel” among others. To learn and share more about these strategies, we bring to you Converge - Sept,2015 which focusses on strategies around designing, developing and managing new age mobile solutions.</p>
