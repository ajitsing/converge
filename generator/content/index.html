<p id=\"_about\" data--100-bottom-top=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(90deg) scale(.5);transform-origin:50% 0;text-align:justify\" data--100-bottom=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(0deg) scale(1)\">In the rapidly changing digital world it's critical for organizations to not only develop products that solve foundational business problem but are also flexible enough to accommodate new features rapidly. As capabilities such as analytics, mobile first, internet of things
become mainstream, it's essential for solution owners to develop a vision for the product even before the first feature is live.<br/><br/>

So what does a product mindset involve? Can it only be applied in a product company? Can product thinker's approach reduce incremental costs and improve the solutions delivered, even in a services
engagement?<br/><br/>

Let's come together for the 6th edition of Converge to learn and share our experiences around product thinking, it's value and the potential pitfalls. We aim to uncover and understand practices
that can be emulated by Analysts and Consultants thereby nurturing a successful product.<br/><br/><p id=\"_about\" data--100-bottom-top=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(90deg) scale(.5);transform-origin:50% 0\" data--100-bottom=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(0deg) scale(1)\"> As a PARTICIPANT, you will connect with like-minded peers and gain insight from industry practitioners. </p>

    subtitle: "The need for adaptation of AGILE methodologies picked up a lot from the late 90’s, even though the pain was being felt since almost 2 decades before. It was finally put together in the AGILE Manifesto in 2001. Today, almost every business is pursuing to bring in significant levels of improvement to the overall Agility. Business Agility refers to the ability of business and it’s processes to respond to changing market conditions, end user preferences, business challenges and market competition. This same capability of being Agile is the intense focus of many organizations. More than often than not, there is a lot of focus and attention towards making the teams Agile via various means. While there are all the good intentions behind such transformations, what's often overlooked or not properly defined is the role of Leadership in an Agile Transformation. Join this talk to rediscover AGILE transformation from a different perspective, and review the pivotal role Leadership plays to make it successful."
