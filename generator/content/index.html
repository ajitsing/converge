<p id=\"_about\" data--100-bottom-top=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(90deg) scale(.5);transform-origin:50% 0;text-align:justify\" data--100-bottom=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(0deg) scale(1)\">In the rapidly changing digital world it's critical for organizations to not only develop products that solve foundational business problem but are also flexible enough to accommodate new features rapidly. As capabilities such as analytics, mobile first, internet of things
become mainstream, it's essential for solution owners to develop a vision for the product even before the first feature is live.<br/><br/>

So what does a product mindset involve? Can it only be applied in a product company? Can product thinker's approach reduce incremental costs and improve the solutions delivered, even in a services
engagement?<br/><br/>

Let's come together for the 6th edition of Converge to learn and share our experiences around product thinking, it's value and the potential pitfalls. We aim to uncover and understand practices
that can be emulated by Analysts and Consultants thereby nurturing a successful product.<br/><br/><p id=\"_about\" data--100-bottom-top=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(90deg) scale(.5);transform-origin:50% 0\" data--100-bottom=\"transform:perspective(400px) rotateX(0deg) scale(1)\"> As a PARTICIPANT, you will connect with like-minded peers and gain insight from industry practitioners. </p>
